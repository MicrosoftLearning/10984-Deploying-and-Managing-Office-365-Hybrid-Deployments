# Module 1: Introduction to Office 365 administration and licensing
# Lab: Provisioning and configuring an Office 365 tenant

### Scenario

Adatum Corporation is considering moving some of the core on-premises services such as Exchange Server, Skype for Business Server, and SharePoint Server, to Office 365. The project steering committee needs to ensure that Office 365 can provide the required functionality and accommodate the corporate security and compliance requirements. To get started, Adatum Corporation has decided to begin a pilot deployment of Office 365 in a hybrid configuration for a group of users. 

As one of the most experienced IT admins at Adatum Corporation, you are responsible for implementing the pilot hybrid project. To begin, you need to configure the Office 365 tenant, and then configure the custom domain that your organization uses. You also need to ensure that you are comfortable with the Office 365 administrator interfaces.

### Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Configure on-premises DNS for later lab exercises.
- Configure an Office 365 tenant and a custom domain.
- Explore the Office 365 administrator interfaces.


> **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Microsoft Office 365. Microsoft Worldwide Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not provided in this manual. Your instructor will provide you with the lab documentation.

### Lab setup

## Exercise 2: Configuring an Office 365 trial tenant

### Scenario
The first step in starting the pilot deployment is to configure the Office 365 tenant. You need to create a new tenant by using the **Adatumyyxxxxx.onmicrosoft.com** domain name. You will also need to verify ownership of the custom domain A*****.xtremelabs.us.

> **Note:** For simplicity, this lab uses an ordinary Office 365 trial account, not a FastTrack pilot extended tenant account. Also, note that you need to create an account with a unique name in the form **Adatumyyxxxxx.onmicrosoft.com**. You can use the alphanumeric value for **yyxxxxx** that is provided for you in the lab interface.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.  Provision an Office 365 E5 trial tenant and global admin account
2.  Add a custom domain and verify ownership
3.  Complete the custom domain setup 
4.  Verify Office 365 service health


#### Task 1: Provision an Office 365 E5 trial tenant and global admin account

  - Company name: **Adatum**
  - Your company size: **50-249 people**
  - Country or region: **United States**

6. Confirm your identity by entering your mobile phone number and selecting **Send Verification Code**.
7. Type the verification code that you received, and then select **Verify**.
8. Create a unique domain for the company name to use in the course. Use the **__Adatumyyxxxxx__** name provided in the lab interface. In addition, you will need to verify it is available by selecting **Check availability**. (Be sure to write it down, as you will use it later.)
9. Select **Next**.
10. Create your business identity by typing **Beth**.
11. Create and confirm your password.
12. Select **Sign up**.
13. Select **Go to setup**.
14. Select **Get started**.

> **Note:** During setup of Office 365, you may receive a variety of welcome or tour pages. Close them if they appear.


#### Task 2: Add a custom domain and verify ownership

1.  On the **Personalize your sign-in and email** page, enter the name of the custom domain you were provided in the lab interface for example Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com.
2.  Write down the **TXT** record shown in the **TXT value** column. This entry will be similar to MS=ms*XXXXXXXX*. Record this value below: MS=\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
3.  Switch to **LON-DC1** and configure the following forward lookup zone:
  - Name: A*****.xtremelabs.us
  - Resource record type: **Text (TXT)**
